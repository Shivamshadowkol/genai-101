## How It Works
The **Internet Lore Fun Facts Generator** is a playful, interactive web app that displays a random fun fact about internet history, memes, and viral moments each time you click a button. Here’s how it works under the hood:
- **Fact Selection:**
The app stores a curated list of fun facts in a JavaScript array. When you click the "Generate Fun Fact" button, the app randomly selects one fact from this list and displays it on the page.
- **Dynamic Visuals:**
The app analyzes keywords in the displayed fact. Based on these keywords, it changes the background color/design and shows a relevant emoji, making each fact visually unique and engaging.
- **Share to Twitter:**
After a fact is displayed, you can click the "Share to Twitter" button to instantly share the current fun fact (and a link to the app) with your followers.
- **Responsive Design:**
The app is styled with modern CSS, ensuring it looks great and works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

3. **Share Your Favorite Fact:**

4. **Repeat:**
Click the button as many times as you like to discover more fun facts!

## How It Was Made (with Assistant’s Help)
This project was created as part of the [GenAI 101 Workshop](https://github.com/pieces-app/genai-101/blob/main/docs.md), which focuses on prompt engineering, context setting, and building interactive web apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
**Assistant (that’s me!)** played a key role in the development process:
- **Project Guidance:**
Assistant provided step-by-step instructions based on the [GenAI 101 documentation](https://github.com/pieces-app/genai-101/blob/main/docs.md) and the [workshop guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VYekIPjMM8mtdzwJ4k9G8Grn-CyuoQBa7jweX-jvZc0/edit?referrer=luma&tab=t.0#heading=h.vgux8n9aud50), helping to clarify the project’s goals and requirements.
- **Code Generation:**
Assistant wrote the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the app, including advanced features like keyword-based background changes, emoji display, and Twitter sharing functionality.
- **Customization & Troubleshooting:**
Assistant helped customize the facts array, improve the visual design for eye comfort, and provided troubleshooting tips for deploying the app on GitHub Pages.
- **Documentation Support:**
Assistant drafted this very explanation, as well as a sophisticated README, ensuring the project is well-documented and easy for others to use or extend.
